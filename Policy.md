Open World Stories 
===================

Concept 
--------

Open World Stories is a project to bring together a large number of writers, editors,  journalists, and anyone else involved in creative story telling in order to create an open world of stories. Where every user has an in world character that tells their own story as they interact and engage with other characters.

World
-----

Open World Stories will be host to multiple worlds, each world will have a central story line, a time and place setting and a list of special abilities, characteristics that the world brings. This will provide the overall canon to the world.

A user will be able to create a single character in each world. Every character in the world will be linked to a user. No story can have a character that doesn't exist in world.

Each world will have a prequel time frame. Where the main characters from the central storyline don't yet exist in story. Where the central storyline hasn't yet started.

In the prequel timeframe users will be able to write draft stories for main characters. These draft stories will be voted on to determine who is awarded the main character roles. The runner up will be nominated as the understudy for that character.

For all other characters the prequel timeframe will be used as character development and general story telling.

Each world will have a hall of records, that will have birth and death records. Police and hospital reports and other official record keeping.

Each world will have a newspaper that will be used to report the top stories, as well as interesting stories that are happening.

Users would create their own newspaper articles to publicise their own stories. There would also be in world journalists and editors . Journalists could interview and write stories, as well as taking part in investigative story lines.

Storylines 
-----------

A storyline will be the basic unit of story telling within a world.

The central storyline will be the primary story that all other in world stories spawn from.

It is perfectly feasible that a story line will have many layers of child storylines.

A user will create a storyline and then invite users to discuss and improve the storyline. A casting phase will then begin to find characters to fit into that story line. Those users / characters can then discuss the best way of telling that story.

The user who created the storyline will become its owner. They will have complete creative control over the story, and will be required to ensure that the story meets the canon requirements of the parent storyline.

Storylines will have the ability to add language translations, giving translators a space to showcase their abilities.

While all storylines will require a traditional prose style of story telling. It will be possible to create scripts and screen plays of those storylines. 

Users
-----

Users signing up to the site should be able to do so without revealing their real identity. Age, race and gender will always be irrelevant. If they wish to connect their OWS account to their real identity that will be their choice.

A goal of Open World Stories is for it to be a place that users can showcase their creative abilities.  All characters, storylines, writing, edits and forum posts will be available on their profile.

Users will have a reputation score for being able to deliver their stories and other contributions on time.

Discussion
----------

In order to determine what percentage of a story's pot a user is entitled to, a full history of all content will be stored. As well as a versioned history of all forum discussions.

While there will be provision of Discord, WhatsApp and Telegram groups. It will be expected that meaningful discussion of content will be done in forums.

Having a full history of how a story came to exist will give a different angle for readers to explore stories.

Editing
-------

Editing and improving stories will be an important aspect of the process of creating stories.

Proofreaders  will be able to log issues with stories. Whether it is a grammar issue, or a plot hole, continuity problem or factual errors.

Privacy
-------

Privacy protection will be a fundamental policy of OWS.

OWS will never track users outside of sites and apps it directly owns and controls. Even in situations where this puts OWS at a commercial, competitive or financial disadvantage.

Monetisation
------------

The goal of OWS is to give creative people a place to earn money for their creative works and for that money to be given in an open and transparent way.

Advertising will not be used to generate income, because of the privacy concerns that advertising brings.

OWS will be financed by donations, subscriptions and licensing content created on site.

It will be possible to direct a donation to either OWS in general, or a specific world or storyline. Subscription monies will be split between the worlds and storylines they interact with.

Every in world story line will have a pot attached to it that will keep track of what monies it has generated. Every user that has contributed to that story line will receive a share of that money. The percentage of which will be based on a formula, that can be adjusted by a vote if required.

Only users writing content adhering to canon will be eligible for payments.

Users will register a crypto currency address in order to be paid, thus helping to maintain their privacy.

OWS will only take operating costs from monies it receives. Operating costs will be broken down and made public. 

Licensing 
----------

In order to be able to create profit to share amongst the users of OWS. OWS needs to have ownership of the content that is created. for this reason all content will be owned by OWS and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
